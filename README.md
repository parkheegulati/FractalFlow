# ðŸ‘¾ FractalFlow

This project was developed as my final week project for Stanford University's Code in Place 2024. It demonstrates the generation and visualization of the Hilbert Curve. 

## Introduction

The Hilbert Curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve first described by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891. This project visualizes the construction of the Hilbert Curve using the Pygame library, providing an interactive way to explore its properties.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/parkheegulati/FractalFlow
    cd FractalFlow
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Pygame:**

    ```sh
    pip install pygame
    ```
## Usage

1. **Run the main script:**

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. **Controls**
```sh
  ESC   ->  to quit ( Close the window )
  R     ->  to restart ( Reset the animation)
  SPACE ->  to switch between color modes
```
